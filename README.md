# Analyzing California Crime Data  

Final Project by Zobia Quraishi

Looking at crime data can be helpful to understand how to best influence structural change. As citizens, we have a duty to advocate for more equitable systems and to vote/campaign for criminal justice measures that are fair. Law and order are important, but it is also important to see as people first and foremost, not labeling people as 'criminals.' I chose to analyze crime data because being less than four days away from being a Cal alumna, the majority of courses of study I took in undergraduate have an emphasis on social justice and to tell the stories of those who often go unheard. Within the public policy minor, I learned about the curb cut effect, which is the idea that helping the most marginalized of all people will in fact benefit all of society. The idea behind creating curbs was to help disabled folks, such as individuals with wheelchairs. Creating curbs, however, in fact benefited all of society, such as mothers who were using strollers or individuals with suitcases. A more-in depth explanation of the curb-cut effect can be found [here](https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/curb-cut-effect).

When analyzing crime data, I try to apply this lens and try to understand the entire narrative. What is the best way forward to promote a just society where everyone is safe, regardless of socioeconomic status or racial background? However, how also can we ensure that those who enter into the carceral system have acted in a way that is justified? Especially now, we are seeing how flawed systems are, with the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Christian Cooper, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and the many more wrongful murders who go largely unheard. Going into this project, I hope to be able to utilize the data I analyze to better understand what type of systemic change is necessary and to note to myself that what I see in the data may not be the entire story, as Professor Rue spoke to in class. 


Within this project, we will be analyzing data from:
* California Crime Data Statistics 
* Juvenile Justice in CA 
* third item

The formula I used was:

```
=VLOOKUP("Something," A2:157, 1, false)
```
