# Analyzing US Crime Data  

Final Project by Zobia Quraishi

Looking at crime data can be helpful to understand how to best influence structural change. As citizens, we have a duty to advocate for more equitable systems and to vote/campaign for criminal justice measures that are fair. Law and order are important, but it is also important to see as people first and foremost, not labeling people as 'criminals.' I chose to analyze crime data because being less than four days away from being a Cal alumna, the majority of courses of study I took in undergraduate have an emphasis on social justice and to tell the stories of those who often go unheard. Within the public policy minor, I learned about the curb cut effect, which is the idea that helping the most marginalized of all people will in fact benefit all of society. The idea behind creating curbs was to help disabled folks, such as individuals with wheelchairs. Creating curbs, however, in fact benefited all of society, such as mothers who were using strollers or individuals with suitcases. A more-in depth explanation of the curb-cut effect can be found [here](https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/curb-cut-effect).

When analyzing crime data, I try to apply this lens and try to understand the entire narrative. What is the best way forward to promote a just society where everyone is safe, regardless of socioeconomic status or racial background? However, how also can we ensure that those who enter into the carceral system have acted in a way that is justified? Especially now, we are seeing how flawed systems are, with the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Christian Cooper, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and the many more wrongful murders who go largely unheard. Going into this project, I hope to be able to utilize the data I analyze to better understand what type of systemic change is necessary and to note to myself that what I see in the data may not be the entire story, as Professor Rue spoke to in class. 


Within this project, we will be analyzing data from:
* California Crime Data Statistics 
* Juvenile Justice in CA 
* Hate Crimes Data from Github

The data that I received from Github on hate crimes per state was already in a usable format.

When analyzing hate crimes per 100,000 populations, it becomes clear that the number of hate crimes varies vastly by location. Certain states have much less of a number of hate crimes than other states. For example, Mississippi has an average of 0.067 hate crimes per 100,000 poulation whereas Oregon has an average of 0.833 hate crimes per 100,000 crimes. What is the reason for this disparity, and how can state officials across the US seek to lessen the amount of hate crimes?

Having been born and raised in California, I was further interested in investigating crime within my home state. I found an interesting data set that showed dangerous trends in domestic violence-related incidents. 

For the California Crime Data from Open Justice, I did not have to clean the data much; however, I did have to upload the CSV to google sheets to remove the commas. Initially, I was confused about why my data was off, but then I realized it was because of the commas. Here is a screenshot of that process. I highlighted all of the data, went to "Format," then "Number," and switched from "Automatic" to "Plain text." I further deleted some of the rows that I felt were not as relevant to the data set.

I felt that this table was extremely helpful to seeing the trends and then further broke some of the data later on this project. 

<iframe title="Domestic Violence-Related Calls for Assistance in California(OpenJustice)" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-GbQmO" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GbQmO/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="635"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>


The table illustrates a noteable spike in domestic violence related incidents involving weapons, increasing from 62,204 crimes in 2013 to 68,585 crimes in 2015. Furthermore, there is an increase in incidents involving a personal weapon, increasing from 49,459 crimes in 2013 to 54,642 crimes in 2015. Looking at these trends, I think about how to make more resources available to support women who may be struggling from domestic violence, whether that be offering more shelters that women who are struggling financially can stay or offering mental health resources.
